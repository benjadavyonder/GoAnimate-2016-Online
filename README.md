please not that the READ ME file is outdated. this had been encountered rarely from a
Wrapper Offline folder.

This is an API wrapper for the Legacy Video Maker, which had been retired on *19th December 2019, 03:10 UTC*.	Unlike other services that attempt to sole the same problem, this project allows the LVM to access data peristence and is very portable.	Please keep in mind that not all features designed to run on the original API work properly.
## How to Use
To access this service, install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) then clone/download this project.	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and execute the following commands in your command prompt (where `{PATH}` is the folder path you copied):
```console
cd {PATH}
npm install
npm start
```
**When done, go to your web browser and navigate to `localhost`.**
